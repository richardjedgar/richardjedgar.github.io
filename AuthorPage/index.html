<P>My first (published) novel, <i>Necessary Lies</i>, is
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Necessary-Lies-Novel-Richard-Edgar-ebook/dp/B079H3WYYF/">
available on Amazon</a>. It's speculative fiction, character-driven with a little
science fiction (in this case, biology). I got interested in the weird situation
same-sex couples were in a few years ago, where they could be legally married in
one state, but if they drove across the bridge to another, they were not related
in any way.</p>

<P>The blurb:</p>

<P>This book is a fantastic look at the complex issues involved in living a "non-traditional life" through the lens of a well-constructed story. The characters are believable, the writing is excellent, it's first and foremost a *good book* - and then, like hidden protein in a sweet dessert, there's the solid core of deeper meaning running throughout. Highly recommended.</p>
