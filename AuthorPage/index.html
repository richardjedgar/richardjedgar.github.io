<P>My first (published) novel, <i>Necessary Lies</i>, is
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Necessary-Lies-Novel-Richard-Edgar-ebook/dp/B079H3WYYF/">
available on Amazon</a>. It's speculative fiction, character-driven with a little
science fiction (in this case, biology). I got interested in the weird situation
same-sex couples were in a few years ago, where they could be legally married in
one state, but if they drove across the bridge to another, they were not related
in any way.</p>

<P>The blurb:</p>

<P><i>This book is a fantastic look at the complex issues involved in living a "non-traditional life" through the lens of a well-constructed story. The characters are believable, the writing is excellent, it's first and foremost a *good book* - and then, like hidden protein in a sweet dessert, there's the solid core of deeper meaning running throughout. Highly recommended.</i></p>

Ravyn's wife moves out, leaving her alone with a large house, the empty shell, really, of a broken home, a broken heart just as large, a broken marriage, broken promises, broken community and friendships, broken dreams. She tells us the tale of her coming-again of age in her 40s, finding most of the pieces and building something new that sort of looks like a life, from the things she has: A big empty house, an empty heart, friends who need some of each, lots of grief, and memories of past lives she might almost wish hadn't ever happened. Who would she have been, if only?
</p><p>
This is a second novel in the series that began with Necessary Lies.
